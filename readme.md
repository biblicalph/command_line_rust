# Command line rust

Implementation of several command line utilities, based on a mixture of the BSD (Berkeley Standard Distribution) and GNU versions.
The implementations are mostly lightweight versions of the originals serving mostly pedagogical purposes in my journey to learn rust.

## Order of implementation

1. [Head program](./headr/readme.md)
2. [Word count program](./wcr/readme.md)
3. [Uniq program](./uniqr/readme.md)
4. [Find program](./findr/readme.md)
